"""Write-only EpicsSignal variant.

Workaround a problem when random failures occur when writing repeatedly
to an EpicsSignal.  During a series of identical data acquisition events,
RuntimeError exceptions have been raised when writing to an EpicsSignal
object, despite many successful previous writes in the same series.

Common to all these failures, is a failed status object where the target
value is not received.  (done=True, success=False)

Create a "write-only" EpicsSignal subclass that restores the simpler
method of EpicsSignalBase.set().
