XPCS bluesky instrument configuration

Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory

## Interactive sessions

From either tcsh or bash shell, this linux command should start an
interactive session (using the present working directory for any
file storage, such as logs): 

```bash
blueskyStarter.sh
```

## Jupyter notebook

Jupyter notebook sessions are not used commonly for bluesky controls.

## Bluesky Queueserver

The [_QS_](./instrument/README.md) is being configured for
initial demonstration at this time.

```bash
# TODO:
```

## Legacy

The previous instrument configuration is stored in the
[ipython-8idiuser](https://github.com/aps-8id-dys/ipython-8idiuser),
which has been archived (made read-only so no new contributions,
issues, pull requests, ... in that repo now).
