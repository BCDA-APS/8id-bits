# NOTES of the next things to do for bluesky

revised: 2024-02-23 (prj)

Add to BDP demo plan:

- (bool) "mesh" : random sample position (as done before in 2023 and earlier)
- (bool) "fly" : move sample axis (? x ?) during measurement

Add new plan to control QNW temperature controller.  This will be a good starting point for initial operations.  We can add features from this.

- (float) setpoint
- (float) ramp rate
- (bool) wait
